Libraries will be testable in isolation through programming libaries
to the design by contract paradigm. That is individual methods will be
tested through testing that return values or changes to internal fields
are correct, given valid input parameters. Test cases will test that
exceptions/errors are thrown when the contract is broken(invalid input
parameters given)

Through testing all individual methods in a class, libraries can be
verified as to be working.
