Changes:

1) GameMap Representation:
    The previous implementation of using a single 2d array to represent the game map was not adequate. In its place
    is two 2d arrays, one representing the terrain/texture files on the map, and another representing objects on the map.
    This was done as cars interact differently to objects (they pick up, use, collide, etc) than they do to terrain tiles
    (driving over or colliding with).

2) GameStateClass:
    The previous implementation of having a model class containing separate cars and a map class was inadequate as loading
     and saving was done through methods in the map class, which didn't work with cars. To fix this a seperate GameState
     class has been created holding all the fields necessary for loading and saving the game, with new wrapper classes
     created for the the GameMap and ObjectMap
